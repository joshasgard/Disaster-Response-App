# Summary üéØ
A web app for an ML pipeline trained and deployed to help emergency responders detect public messages (tweets, FB posts, texts, etc.) asking for aid during disasters and emergencies. Victims and witnesses can also use the app to check the relevant agencies to call upon.

### Data
* The disaster response data contains tweets and text messages gathered by FigureEight Inc. after major disasters and labelled into 36 different categories of victim needs. 
* The raw data files are two `.csv` files containing the messages and categories respectively. About 26400 of the messages were given here. 

### ETL Pipeline
* The data cleaning process was done in an ETL pipeline. It involves data extraction from `.csv`, merging, and data transformation by string splitting, type casting, duplicate removal and filtering. The clean data is then loaded into an SQlite DB.

### ML Pipeline
* The ML pipeline, with a **Random Forest Classifier (RF)** as estimator, is fitted to the dataset here. 
* Our clean messages serve as the predictor variable while the 36 categories are the MultiOutput target from the pipeline. Hyperparameter Tuning using **Grid Search (with Cross Validation)** was carried out to find the hyperparameters giving the optimum model performance. 
* During the modelling process, a **Naive Bayes Classifier and an AdaBoost Classifier** were also fitted to the dataset. But there is no significant difference in their performance compared to the RF classifier. Hence, we stuck with the latter. 
* The pipeline dumps the trained model to a pickle file and returns model **Precision, Recall and Accuracy** as performance metrics. 

### Web App 
* The web app allows a user to input a single message as a sentence and the trained model returns the disaster categories the message falls with a few relevant agencies to call upon.

### Deployment
* To Heroku. *Live link will be provided later*

# Imbalanced Data ‚öñÔ∏è
### Imbalanced Data
* The dataset is heavily imbalanced for most of the message categories, particularly important ones like `'water', 'fire', 'missing people', 'death', 'hospital', 'electricity', and 'transport'` have very few representation. This means the model performs 
* Even with **Stratified Sampling** through Grid Search Cross Validation to maintain weights, our model still overfits (i.e. predicts 0 most of the times) for these categories. Hence, we have unreasonably high or low precisions and recalls for the classes. 

### Emphasizing Precision and/or Recall
* Precision, calculated as `TP/(TP + FP)`, is a model metric that punishes classification of messages into a category they do not belong (False Positves, returns 1 instead of 0). The higher the number of misclassifications in that category, the lower the precision value of the model for the category and vice-versa. Recall, calculated as the true positive rate `TP/(TP + FN)`, is a model performance metric that helps to measure the failure of a model to detect messages that belong to a category (False Negatives, returns 0 instead of 1). 

* We have a small positive to negative class ratio for most of the disaster category in the dataset, which supports our interest of detecting relevant messages (positive class) out of a multitude in a disaster. 

* **Hence, for each of the 36 categories, our choice of metric depends on whether it is more costly for our model to detect some wrong messages (precision) or fail to detect some messages of people that need emergency help (Recall) or both (f1 score). In this case, we can afford to detect some irrelevant messages for most categories, but we can't afford to miss messages of people that need help. **.
